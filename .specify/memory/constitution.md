# Swiftbird Documentation Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Documentation Excellence (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All documents MUST be well-written, clearly articulated, and professionally formatted. Every document must have a clear purpose, target audience, and deliver value to Swiftbird stakeholders. Poor quality, unclear, or poorly structured documents will be rejected regardless of technical merit.

**Rationale**: As the central knowledge repository for Swiftbird organization, documentation quality directly impacts organizational effectiveness and professional image.

### II. Markdown Standardization

All documentation MUST be written in Markdown format following consistent formatting standards. Documents must use proper heading hierarchy, consistent code block formatting, appropriate linking, and standardized front matter where applicable.

**Rationale**: Standardized formatting ensures consistency, maintainability, and compatibility across different platforms and tools.

### III. Mandatory Review Process

No document may be published or made available without prior review and explicit approval. All changes, additions, and updates must go through the established review workflow before being merged to the main branch.

**Rationale**: Quality control and accuracy verification are essential for maintaining credibility and preventing misinformation in organizational documentation.

### IV. Best Practices Compliance

All documentation must follow established best practices for technical writing, information architecture, and content organization. This includes proper structure, clear navigation, accurate information, and appropriate use of examples and references.

**Rationale**: Consistent application of best practices ensures high-quality user experience and effective knowledge transfer.

### V. Comprehensive Coverage

Documentation must cover technical details, organizational information, processes, and any other knowledge relevant to Swiftbird operations. Each document must be complete within its scope and provide sufficient context for its intended audience.

**Rationale**: Complete and comprehensive documentation prevents knowledge gaps and supports organizational transparency and effectiveness.

## Content Standards

**Accuracy Requirement**: All information must be factually correct, up-to-date, and verifiable. Sources must be cited where appropriate, and claims must be substantiated.

**Clarity Requirement**: Content must be written in clear, professional language appropriate for the target audience. Technical jargon must be explained or linked to definitions.

**Completeness Requirement**: Each document must be self-contained or properly linked to related information. Missing critical information or broken internal references are unacceptable.

## Review Process

**Review Authority**: All documents require approval from designated reviewers before publication. Reviewers are responsible for verifying accuracy, clarity, completeness, and adherence to these principles.

**Quality Gates**: Documents must pass checks for grammar, formatting, technical accuracy, and organizational alignment before approval.

**Version Control**: All changes must be tracked through version control with clear commit messages and appropriate branching strategies.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other documentation practices and guidelines. All document creation, modification, and review processes must verify compliance with these principles. Non-compliance must be justified with explicit rationale and approved by reviewers.

Amendment of this constitution requires documentation of the change rationale, stakeholder approval, and a migration plan for existing content affected by the changes.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-11-05 | **Last Amended**: 2025-11-05
